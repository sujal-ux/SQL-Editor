## Page Load Time

The page load time of this application has been measured with the help of [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) which is an automated tool provided by Google.

Below are metrices provided by the Lighthouse to measure page load time. 

| Item                           | Time  |
| ------------------------------ | ----  | 
| FCP (First Contentful Paint)   | 1.0 s |
| SI (Speed Index)               | 1.5 s | 
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | 1.1 s | 
| TTI (Time to Interactive)      | 1.3 s | 
| TBT (Total Blocking Time)      | 230 ms| 
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)  | 0.00  |

I took care of the below factors to obtain the optimal page performance.
- I have employed minimal style state management to minimize the data being stored in the form states, so that overall output can be reached without throttling the application.
- Used minified build version of fontawesome instead of react library of fontawesome, to further cutdown the performance cost.
